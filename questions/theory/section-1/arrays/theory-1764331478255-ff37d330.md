  - text: "Regardless of the actual number of elements in a list, insertion and removal of an element can be performed in a fixed time."
    correct: false
  - text: "Moving to the middle of a list takes an amount of time proportional to the number of elements, as it requires visiting all the entries from the beginning to the middle."
    correct: false
  - text: "In addition to space for each element in a list, space for a pointer to the next element is also required."
    correct: false
  - text: "Regardless of the actual number of elements in a list, some space may remain unused as the space for storing the maximum number of elements is pre-allocated."
    correct: true
  - text: "In an array-based implementation, the size of the array automatically grows and shrinks with every insertion and removal without any overhead."
    correct: false
  - text: "Array-based lists always require extra space for pointers to the next element."
