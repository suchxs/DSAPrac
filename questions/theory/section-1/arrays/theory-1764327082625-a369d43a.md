Let A be an array of integers of size 10, whose ith entry is represented by A[i] for i = 0 to 9, and its initial value is 0. For a positive integer k, the rules below determine the entry in which the value k is stored. When integers 16, 43, 73, 24, and 85 are processed in this order, in which entry is the last value 85 stored? Here, x mod y represents the remainder after the division of x by y.
