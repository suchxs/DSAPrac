choices:
  - text: "In open hashing (chaining), searching for an element always takes constant time regardless of load factor."
    correct: false
  - text: "In closed hashing, linear probing guarantees that all collisions are resolved in exactly two probes."
    correct: false
  - text: "In closed hashing, as packing density increases, the number of collisions increases."
    correct: true
  - text: "A hash table with a load factor greater than 1 has fewer collisions than one with a load factor below 0.5."
    correct: false
  - text: "If M elements are evenly distributed by the hash function in an open hash table with N array size, then the running time of operation member is O(N/M)."
    correct: false
  - text: "A perfect hash function for a given set of N elements is a function that maps each element to a distinct integer within the range and produces a few collisions."
